# Angular Tutorial

Using NPM, rather than bower. [The tutorial can be found here.](http://campus.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js/intro)


## Development

Install dependencies.

```sh
npm install angular
npm install bootstrap
```

Open the application in a browser.

```sh
open index.html
```

Run local python webserver to avoid browser security issues with asynchronous requests.

```sh
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8081
open http://localhost:8081
```
